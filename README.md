# GIS_Approach_on_Covid19

This Project is inspired by an assignment “Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods”, as one of requirements to achieve the “Applied Data Science Capstone” digital badge.
As the total positive cases of COVID19 in Indonesia keep rising, especially in Jakarta as one of its epicenter, this article discusses a visual approach to determine strategic locations for masks and medical devices distribution for COVID-19 treatment. Data is based on confirmed cases as of May 28, 2020  in the red zone areas to measure “new normal” readiness. 
The initial idea is developed right after a brief brainstorming with SWG’s Spatial Data Solution Specialist, [Vannia Alfian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vannia-alfiani-5844a5102/). A few references also contributes to this article, such as [(Rama Yusvana, 2020)](https://medium.com/@yusvana/visual-approach-to-determine-strategic-location-for-a-new-covid-19-testing-center-in-jakarta-using-cc76016268e3) and [(Arnab Kumar Shil, 2020)](https://ruddra.com/posts/project-battle-of-capstones/#step-four-collect-hospital-data-from-foursquare).
